      <h1>Treaty of Waitangi</h1>
      <p>The Treaty of Waitangi is a treaty first signed
         on 6 February 1840 by representatives of the British Crown and Māori chiefs (rangatira) from the 
         North Island of New Zealand. To the political constitution of the state, and to the national mythos 
         of New Zealand it has become a document of central importance to the history, and has 
         played a major role in framing the political relations between New Zealand's government 
         and the Māori population, especially from the late-20th century.
      </p>
      <p>
          It was written in time when the New Zealand Company, acting on behalf of large numbers of settlers and 
         would-be settlers , and when some Māori leaders had petitioned the British for protection against French incursions. 
         It was drafted with the intention of establishing a British Governor of New Zealand, 
         recognising Māori ownership of their lands, forests and other possessions, and giving Māori 
         the rights of British subjects. It was intended by the British Crown to ensure that when Lieutenant 
         Governor William Hobson subsequently made the declaration of British sovereignty over New Zealand in 
         May 1840, the Māori people would not feel that their rights had been ignored.
         Once it had been written and translated, it was first 
         signed by Northern Māori leaders at Waitangi. 
         Copies were subsequently taken around New Zealand and over the following months many other
         chiefs signed.Around 530 to 540 Māori, at least 13 of them women, 
         signed the Māori language version of the Treaty of Waitangi, despite 
         some Māori leaders cautioning against it.An immediate result of the 
         Treaty was that Queen Victoria's government gained the sole right to 
         purchase land.There are nine signed copies of this Treaty.
      </p>
      <p>
         In the second half of the 19th century Māori generally lost control of much of the land they
         had owned, sometimes through legitimate sale, but often due to unfair land-deals, settlers occupying 
         land that had not been sold, or through outright confiscations in the aftermath of
         the New Zealand Wars.
